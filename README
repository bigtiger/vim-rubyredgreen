Rubyredgreen.vim
============

Rubyredgreen.vim is a vim (http://www.vim.org) plugin that runs Ruby tests
(test/unit, Rspec) and shows the test run status with a red or green bar. It
also parses test output and adds the results to your quickfix list.

Installation
------------

Copy all files to your ~/.vim directory.

Usage
-----

After installation, press <Leader>t will run the tests for the current file.

example:

$ cd <your rails/merb root>
$ vim test/unit/user_test.rb
(move cursor into a test case, press <Leader>t)

(<Leader> is mapped to '\' by default in vim)


Default Key Bindings
--------------------

<Leader>t: run test file

You can change default key bindings:

  map <Leader>] <Plug>RubyFileRun " change from <Leader>t to <Leader>]

Credits
-------

Based on code from the rubytest.vim plugin (http://github.com/reinh/vim-rubytest)
but considerably refactored and modified for this more specific purpose.

Red/Green bar code borrowed from Gary Bernhardt
(http://bitbucket.org/garybernhardt/dotfiles/src/tip/.vimrc) and slightly
modified for my use. Please do check out Gary's coding videos on his blog for
more awesome vim usage (http://blog.extracheese.org/).
